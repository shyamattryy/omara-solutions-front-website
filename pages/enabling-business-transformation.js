                                <p>Digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, fundamentally changing how you operate and deliver value to customers. It's also a cultural change that requires organizations to continually challenge the experiment, and get comfortable with failure. The global business environment is experiencing major shifts with the expansion of the Digital Economy. Gone are the days when organizations ruled the market. Consumers are now at the forefront of organizational change as they continue to demand more personalized, digitally-led offerings and experiences throughout their entire customer journeys. They also expect consistent and seamless access to a company and its products and services across all engagement channels, anywhere and at any time. Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to transform existing traditional and non-digital business processes and services, or creating new ones, to meet the evolving market and customer expectations, thus completely altering the way businesses are managed and operated, and how value is delivered to customers. </p>

                                <p>Digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, fundamentally changing how you operate and deliver value to customers. It's also a cultural change that requires organizations to continually challenge the experiment, and get comfortable with failure.

                                <h3>Digital Business Transformation Strategy</h3>
                                <p>
                                    A future-wise and ready digital strategy should be viewed as the cornerstone of digital transformation, bridging the company from where it currently stands in its analog world to where it needs to be in the digital. Surprisingly, several companies have started their journey without a proper strategy in place. Some are due to misalignment as to what an effective digital strategy entails. A digital business transformation strategy should be purposed with crafting a new identity and business model rather than simply augmenting the existing with new technologies. This strategy must therefore answer the fundamental why-, what, and how questions for the business. Some specific areas when defining the new strategy should include determining the needs and behaviors of new-age customers; creating customer personas to guide the development and delivery of end-to-end customer experiences; establishing new KPIs to measure the success of the transforming business; transforming the data environment to enable true business intelligence; transforming the applications environment to seamlessly connect the business; an organizational change management approach; as well as analyzing market trends and understanding how digital is impacting the business, from a global standpoint. We, OMRA Solutions are working by keeping all our tracks recorded, and we are managing all our transformation strategies.

                                <p>Up skilling and deskilling the workforce is no doubt a top priority for organizations around the world. However, organizational leaders need to focus beyond having resources with the right technical capabilities to instill a start-up culture throughout the business. This will require employees to also have the right mindsets, beliefs, and behaviors that support continuous change and innovation. Consequently, employees can latch on to their traditional ways of doing things and prevent digital from being the true catalyst for creating and sustaining long-term business value. There are several mechanisms that can be used to foster an innovative culture, such as formalizing internal channels for sharing and rewarding innovative ideas-, and creating a digital workplace to enable greater flexibility, mobility, and collaboration in the workforce. However, to avoid transformation pitfalls, it is most critical that executives are also digital-minded and invested in the transformation.</p>
