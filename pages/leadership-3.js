                                <p>Digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, fundamentally changing how you operate and deliver value to customers. It's also a cultural change that requires organizations to continually challenge the experiment, and get comfortable with failure. The global business environment is experiencing major shifts with the expansion of the Digital Economy. Gone are the days when organizations ruled the market. Consumers are now at the forefront of organizational change as they continue to demand more personalized, digitally-led offerings and experiences throughout their entire customer journeys. They also expect consistent and seamless access to a company and its products and services across all engagement channels, anywhere and at any time. Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to transform existing traditional and non-digital business processes and services, or creating new ones, to meet the evolving market and customer expectations, thus completely altering the way businesses are managed and operated, and how value is delivered to customers. </p>
