                                <p>Digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, fundamentally changing how you operate and deliver value to customers. It's also a cultural change that requires organizations to continually challenge the experiment, and get comfortable with failure. The global business environment is experiencing major shifts with the expansion of the Digital Economy. Gone are the days when organizations ruled the market. Consumers are now at the forefront of organizational change as they continue to demand more personalized, digitally-led offerings and experiences throughout their entire customer journeys. They also expect consistent and seamless access to a company and its products and services across all engagement channels, anywhere and at any time. Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to transform existing traditional and non-digital business processes and services, or creating new ones, to meet the evolving market and customer expectations, thus completely altering the way businesses are managed and operated, and how value is delivered to customers. </p>

                                <p>Businesses are constantly driven by their inherent instincts to survive, grow, sustain and flourish. The concept of an enterprise operating as a living, breathing organism has been explored for several decades now. Many organizations aren’t experiencing the full value that technology can deliver. This short playbook by OMRA Solutions introduces you to the “Why” and “How” of a modern IT operating model to overcome barriers to delivering optimized outputs from your IT infrastructure. With technology driving transformation, the long-term sustainable value will only be created by unifying business and technology strategies to create exponential value for companies.  </p>
                                <h3>THE IMPERATIVE FOR CHANGE</h3>
                                <p>
                                    As the pace, scale, and impact of technological innovation and disruption have exponentially escalated, technology has become a primary influence on business strategy, strategic choices, and value-creation models. Five technology-driven forces add to the already complex range of decisions facing the C-suite and other business leaders:

                                </p>
                                <ul className="bullets space-section">
                                    <li>Identify alternative technology models and solutions that address key risks•	Convergence - The fusion of physical and digital worlds has blurred industry boundaries, tangled value chains, and disrupted traditional value creation models</li>
                                    <li>Data proliferation - Mountains of data and applied intelligence can inform decisions that allow businesses to adapt and remain ahead of disruption.</li>
                                    <li>Competing horizons - C-suite leaders often must simultaneously manage today’s business while building the company of the future. Strategic choices made today have long-lasting implications and should be made in the context of a broader and fast-moving ecosystem.</li>
                                    <li>Customer empowerment. Technology has created rapidly evolving norms for engaging customers, triggering turnover and fragmentation in customer experience.</li>
                                    <li>Speed and volatility - The cloud and other technologies have lowered barriers to entry, allowing new business models to be developed and launched in weeks and drastically reducing the shelf life of both competitive advantages and existing business models. </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The global pandemic has had a tremendous impact on the global and Indian technology services industry. There are several immediate shifts as well as global mega-trends that offer new opportunities and challenges which need to be thought of now. New delivery models, the workforce of the future, and the digital, consumer, and emerging ecosystems are themes that will affect the industry in a big way. Companies need to develop a two-part response to the evolving landscape: the near-term plan of action and long-term strategic rethinking.</p>
