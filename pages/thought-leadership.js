                                <p>Smart contracts have been in existence for some time now. This was developed to solve the issue of mistrust between parties and business partners. For a wide range of industries, smart contracts pose the advantages of reduced unnecessary expenditures, time, and costs. These make the contracts programmable, have no ambiguity as each party to the contract knows the rules (and therefore codes), and are faster to execute. Upon meeting a few pre-conditions defined in the program, the contract is automatically executed and settled. And when it comes to storing smart contracts, blockchain becomes the ideal choice as it is immutable and secure. </p>

                                <h3>Why Blockchain</h3>

                                <p>The data from smart contracts is encrypted on a shared ledger. This is the usual process which makes it more-than-difficult to lose the information stored in the blocks. The advantage of using blockchain here is its flexibility. The data that is stored can be of any type, and developers can select from myriad transaction options.</p>

                                <p className="paragraph-box">Besides reducing transaction costs, blockchain-based smart contracts make transactions and other business processes more secure, efficient, and cost-effective. This makes it perfect for large-scale deployments in industries such as finance, life science, and art.  In fact, any organization that must deal with high volume of transactions and longer mean time to resolve issues should opt for block-chain based contracts.

                                </p>

                                <p> If the entire process could be programmed and executed based on preconditions being met, the entire duration could be reduced to 30 to 60 minutes, and most disputes would be automatically resolved.</p>

In most cases, once payment is made, it takes anywhere from two to six weeks for the payment to reflect in government records.</p>

                            <h3>The NXT for Blockchain</h3>
                            <p>Blockchain has all the characteristics to be building block of Web 3.0. This technology will lead to the proliferation of decentralized applications— starkly different from the centralized offerings that we consume today from big techs. Truly, the advent of blockchain has been the most significant innovation since the internet.</p>

                            <p className="paragraph-box">Smart contracts are one of the biggest use cases for blockchain. As a company, we foresee that most consumer grade contracts (telephone, insurance, bank accounts, credit cards, remittance) will move further towards blockchain. While most organizations within the B2B space will use smart contracts in pockets today, over time this is expected to become mainstream in this space as well.</p>

                            <p className="space-section">Through NXT.NOW™ we are constantly working with customers and partners to be at the forefront of this important industry development. We have been included in the 2021 Forbes Blockchain 50 Companies, and rated as the top 10 famous blockchain development companies in India by TopAppDevelopmentCompanies.com in 2021-2022. We continue our work towards building frameworks, model contracts, and user journeys that ensure our customers are able to leverage the power of smart contracts to offer a differentiated offering to their customers.</p></div>
