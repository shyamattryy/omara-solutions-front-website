                                <p className="paragraph-box">Time attendance is a basic HR process affecting everyone and critical as a basic input to the payroll process. HR faces problems of integrating attendance inputs from different attendance logging systems e.g. Cards, biometric scanners and manual attendance register across all business locations. Each month a lot of HR time is spent collecting and reconciling attendance data before payroll can be correctly processed. Attendance software gives you the ability to collect data from multiple sources and track your employees' time and attendance automatically as per the company rules and policies. Attendance software communicates with attendance devices to fetch employee punches from the device and calculate daily attendance based on a daily basis or work hour basis. It also calculates total work time, overtime, late in, early out for each employee in accordance with the rules that apply to an employee or a group of employees.</p>

                            Reconciling employee attendance is a very crucial task for each HR manager and involves a lot of expensive time. Defining leave rules is not just where it ends, but managing leaves and updating employee leaves on a regular basis to keep the payroll accurate is a very tedious and time consuming task. Our team has put in a very considerable effort to create, manage and track employee leave by creating a new module for OMRA Solutions. This Leave management module simplifies the complex task of monthly reconciliation of leaves of each employee and allows the managers and HR admin to handle employee leave efficiently and systematically maintaining the flexibility.

                            </p>
                            <p className="paragraph-box">A Significant amount of expensive employee, manager and HR time is wasted in a very basic HR process. To handle this we have seamlessly integrated the leave management with an employee self-service portal that allows employees to apply for leaves / submit a leave request which goes to the immediate reporting head. Employees can also view their leave balances and track their leaves for each month using the employee self-service portal. This tool, leave management with employee self-service portal considerably reduces the load on HR and simplifies the cumbersome task of managing the employee attendance and leave for a month to month basis. Define leave types or create new leave types based on our company's time-off policy. We color code each leave type, enable IP restrictions and customize based, on - location, roles, employees, gender, marital status, etc., you can also configure the list of holidays based on location and other influencing factors. This eliminates confusion and potential conflicts. The Human Resource Management System (HRMS) is a set of tools designed to automate and manage recruiting and staffing operations at OMRA Solutions. By posting your jobs to keep applicants connected and engaged throughout, OMRA Solutions recruitment management lets you manage your entire recruiting process along with employee on boarding. </p>
